# Tic Tac Toe Project
## Milestone 1: Project setup

Setup project as it is described in requirements.

In addition, create 2 main directories:

- lib - for the game logic (HINT: as this directory is empty you can use .gitkeep file)
- bin - with the [executable file] https://commandercoriander.net/blog/2013/02/16/making-a-ruby-script-executable/) called main.rb.

main.rb file should be responsible for user interaction. This is the only one place where puts and get.chomp can be used.
Make your main.rb file displaying “Hello world!” when you use bin/main.rb as a bash command.
